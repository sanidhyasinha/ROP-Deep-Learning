# **Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) Classification Using Fundus Images and Deep Learning**

## **Overview**
This project focuses on the **detection and classification of Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP)** stages from retinal fundus images using advanced **Deep Learning** techniques, particularly **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Transfer Learning**. ROP is a major cause of preventable blindness in premature infants, and this automated system aims to assist ophthalmologists in early and accurate diagnosis.

By leveraging deep learning algorithms, the project provides:
- Detection of abnormal blood vessel growth and tortuosity.
- Multi-class classification of ROP stages (Stage 1 to Stage 5).
- Identification of **plus disease** associated with severe ROP.

## **Introduction**
**Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP)** is a retinal vascular disease seen in premature infants due to incomplete retinal blood vessel development. If left untreated, ROP can progress to blindness. Early diagnosis and treatment are critical to prevent severe vision loss.

This project automates the ROP classification process through deep learning and provides an efficient solution for:
- Detecting **ROP stages** (mild to severe).
- Identifying **plus disease**, characterized by vessel dilation and tortuosity.
- Reducing the workload of ophthalmologists, especially in under-resourced settings.

---

## **Dataset**
The model is trained and tested on publicly available **fundus image datasets** for ROP classification.  

### **Dataset Details**:
- **Source**: Kaggle ROP dataset, DRIVE dataset, or custom clinical data.
- **Labels**:  
  - Normal  
  - Stage 1 (Mild ROP)  
  - Stage 2 (Moderate ROP)  
  - Stage 3 (Severe ROP with ridge formation)  
  - Stage 4 (Partial retinal detachment)  
  - Stage 5 (Complete retinal detachment)  
  - Plus Disease

### **Folder Structure**:
```bash
data/
    â”œâ”€â”€ train/         # Training images
    â”œâ”€â”€ test/          # Test images
    â”œâ”€â”€ val/           # Validation images
    â”œâ”€â”€ annotations/   # Image labels
```

## **Preprocessing Steps**
Fundus images are preprocessed for optimal input to the deep learning model:
1. **Image Resizing**: Standardized to 224x224 pixels.
2. **Normalization**: Scale pixel values between 0â€“1.
3. **Noise Removal**: Gaussian filters to reduce image noise.
4. **Contrast Enhancement**: Histogram equalization or CLAHE.
5. **Data Augmentation**:
   - Random rotation
   - Horizontal flipping
   - Brightness/contrast adjustments

## **Model Architecture**

### **1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
The project uses CNN-based models for image classification:
- **Custom CNN**:  
  Consists of convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

### **2. Transfer Learning**
Pre-trained models are fine-tuned on the ROP dataset:
- **ResNet50**
- **DenseNet121**
- **EfficientNetB0**  

These models enable faster convergence and better performance, especially with small datasets.
